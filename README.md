# About Project:
This project includes Html5, css3, Js, Jquery, Font-awesome. This project manages task of user. 
User can add task, delete task, edit task, search task based on task title.
User can not repeat task based on task name otherwise User will get alert ‘duplicate entry not allowed’. 
User will get no tasks data if ‘No Tasks Available’ in local storage and task array and will get ‘No Match Found’ message when there’s no tasks related to search User made.
I am storing user task data with task description in User’s browser local storage. Made this application  responsive using media query.
